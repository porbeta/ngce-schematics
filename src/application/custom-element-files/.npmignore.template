# See https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/developers for more about ignoring files.
# If there's no .npmignore file, but there is a .gitignore file, then npm will ignore the stuff matched by the .gitignore file.
# If you want to include something that is excluded by your .gitignore file, you can create an empty .npmignore file to override it.


# Ignore all files

# Include the following
!dist/**/*
